# History

The original idea of Stamps belongs to [Eric Elliott](https://ericelliottjs.com/). See his [first commit](https://github.com/stampit-org/stampit/commit/ac330e8537e349a9640bbe4a34c63150db445a20) from 11 Feb 2013 in the stampit repository. Since then the idea evolved to [specification](/specification.md) and a whole [ecosystem](/ecosystem.md) of modules.

# Using Stamps

Head straight to the [Quick start](/start.md) for code examples.

# Ecosystem

Stampit have a lot of helper modules. You can always find the list of official NPM packages here: [https://www.npmjs.com/~stamp](https://www.npmjs.com/~stamp)

See more information on the [Ecosystem](/ecosystem.md) page.
