# What is stampit

`stampit` is a JavaScript module which implements the [stamp specification](https://www.gitbook.com/book/stampit-org/docs/edit#). Stamps are composable factory functions.

Think of stamps as classic classes but without any limits, boundaries, or rules.

# History

The original idea of Stamps belongs to [Eric Elliott](https://ericelliottjs.com/). See his [first commit](https://github.com/stampit-org/stampit/commit/ac330e8537e349a9640bbe4a34c63150db445a20) from 11 Feb 2013 in the stampit repository. Since then the idea evolved to the [specification](/specification.md) and a whole [ecosystem](/ecosystem.md) of mini modules.

# Using Stamps

Head straight to the [Quick start](/start.md) for code examples.
